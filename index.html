        <p>As an accomplished professional with extensive years of experience
          in digital marketing, business development, and customer success, I
          have now decided to embark onto the next phase of my professional
          career as a software engineer. I am excited to learn full-stack web
          development and work as a software engineer for companies such as
          Google, Spotify, Nike, Adobe, Etc. I am also excited to use the skillset
          I will develop from LearningFuze to build an application to help
          musicians track and alayze their streaming analytics which will
          help them create goal-specific marketing campaigns.</p>

        <p>After I graduated from UCLA, I worked at ALEKS Corporation as the
          Customer Support Supervisor, where I managed a team of 9 customer
          support representatives. I was resposible for working with the software
          engineer and user experience teams to minimize the top customer-facing
          issues as well as better enhacing the software to make it more user friendly.
          From there, I joined Moonbug Entertainment as the Digital Marketing Manager
          where I was responsible for managing the social media channels and digital branding
          for arguably two of the biggest IPs in the children's entertainment space, CoComelon, and Blippi.
          My most current work experience is at The Shalizi Group, one of the top music management companies
          with multi-platinum artists such as Marshmello, Alesso, 808 Mafia Southside, and many more. At The Shalizi
          Group I worked as the Digital Marketing Manager and I was responsbile for content creation, paid advertising,
          and brand development.</p>
